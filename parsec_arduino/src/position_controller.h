// Class for the Parallax Position Controller Device.
class PositionController {
 public:
  // Constructs a position controller object. Communication is done by
  // receiving and sending bytes via the given functions. Reads may return -1
  // on error, or an unsigned char.
  //
  // Since bytes are transmitted and received over the same wire, changing
  // back from transmitting to receiving is critical, both for ourselves and the
  // position controller we talk to, to make sure we do not miss any bytes.
  //
  // After reading, we wait 150 microseconds before writing to give the
  // position controller enough time to set RXEN, even when currently
  // handling its interrupts.
  //
  // Writing is not an issue. Assume that writing a byte takes about 50 us,
  // e.g., 19200 baud, and is done when the write function returns. This means
  // it takes about 150 microseconds to send three bytes. Therefore, if the
  // interrupts of the position controller are faster, we will not overflow the
  // receive buffer (2 bytes in the receive FIFO and one in the shift register).
  //
  // Setting RXEN after transmitting also has to happen on our side. We set the
  // transmit delay of the position controller to 300 microseconds, so all
  // interrupts running here have to be faster.
